  title: 'Getting started with the Android Large Screen changes'
  sections:
  - heading: Overview
    text: 'The starting scene is the unmodified 2D example from The Lost Crypt Unity project.  While you can compile and build for Android, there will be a number of visual issues when orientation changes occur.  The Android size compatibility mode will be invoked and the user will be asked to restart the app when configuration changes occur.'

  - heading: "Preparing to handle configuration changes"
    text: The first step to support Large Screen optimized support in your Unity
      project is to update the AndroidManifest file to support the OnConfigurationChanged
      event.  The Unity activity does not expose this event to the C# portion of
      the engine, we will extend the UnityPlayerActivity to support this event.  There is an example java file included in the Plugins\Android folder called LargeScreenPlayableActivity.java that handles the configuration event and passes this to the Unity C# layer.

    text: "Custom activity instead of default Unity activity.\n\nTo extend the default
      Unity activity, you create your own custom activity and set it as the application\u2019s
      entry point."
